## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?


A method allows one to name a piece of code like a variable names strings and numbers, so it can be used quickly and easily repeatedly.


1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.


```ruby
def hello
  p "Sam I am"
end
```


1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.


```ruby
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end
```


1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?


```ruby
hello_someone("Sam")
```


1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?


Everything makes sense so far. I'm sure I'll have more questions as I learn more.
